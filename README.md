With over six years of professional experience in computer science and machine learning, I have worked on various projects, including:

- **Canada Wildfire Prediction using Machine Learning**
- **Image Object Detection of Eucalyptus Crops using Deep Learning**
- **3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation from LiDAR Data**

Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandrebrown/) to learn more or connect with me.

Some open-source projects I have published include:

- [Canada Wildfire Prediction using Deep Learning](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/WildfirePrediction)
- [Image Cloud Semantic Segmentation using Deep Learning](https://github.com/GIF-7005-Projet/cloud-cover-detection)
- [Aerial Semantic Segmentation using Deep Learning](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/AerialSemanticSegmentation)
- [Experiment on Adapting TDM Models to Images for Visual Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/VisualTDM)  

I am currently conducting research at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/) (Montreal Quebec AI Institute). My research interests include:

- **Deep Visual Reinforcement Learning**: Leveraging images as input to deep RL policies.
- **Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning**: Focusing on multi-modality with image and text goals.
- **Real-World Deployable RL Solutions**: Developing methods that require minimal hardware, such as just an RGB camera.
