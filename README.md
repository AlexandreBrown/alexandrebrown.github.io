With over six years of professional experience in computer science and machine learning, various projects I worked on include but are not limited to :  
- Image Object Detection of Eucalyptus Crops using Deep Learning
- 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation from LiDAR Data    

Feel free to check [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandrebrown/) to learn more or to connect with me.

Some open source projects I published include but are not limited to :   
- [Canada Wildfire Prediction using Deep Learning](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/WildfirePrediction)
- [Image Cloud Semantic Segmentation using Deep Learning](https://github.com/GIF-7005-Projet/cloud-cover-detection)
- [Aerial Semantic Segmentation using Deep Learning](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/AerialSemanticSegmentation)
- [Experiment on Adapting TDM Models to Images for Visual Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/VisualTDM)  

I am currently conducting research at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/) (Montreal Quebec AI Institute).  
My research interests include:

- **Deep Visual Reinforcement Learning**: Leveraging images as input to deep RL policies.
- **Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning**: Focusing on multi-modality with image and text goals.
- **Real-World Deployable RL Solutions**: Developing methods that require minimal hardware, such as just an RGB camera.

Feel free to explore my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/) and check out my ongoing research on [Visual Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.notion.so/alexandrebrown-visual-deep-rl/Visual-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Research-6b8b9544fd2d42a898aa6256be0fd502).
