With over six years of experience in computer science and machine learning, I am currently conducting research at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/) (Montreal Quebec AI Institute).  
My research interests include:

- **Deep Visual Reinforcement Learning**: Leveraging images as input to deep RL policies.
- **Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning**: Focusing on multi-modality with image and text goals.
- **Real-World Deployable RL Solutions**: Developing methods that require minimal hardware, such as just an RGB camera.

Feel free to explore my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/AlexandreBrown/) and check out my ongoing research on [Visual Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.notion.so/alexandrebrown-visual-deep-rl/Visual-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Research-6b8b9544fd2d42a898aa6256be0fd502).
